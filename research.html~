<h1>evidentials and attitudes</h1>

<div align="justify">

<p>My dissertation encompasses several projects on evidentials and attitudes. My committee is as follows: <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ysharvit/">Yael Sharvit</a>, UCLA (co-chair), <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/sportich/sportich.htm">Dominique Sportiche</a>, UCLA (co-chair), <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/stabler/">Ed Stabler</a>, UCLA, <a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~panand/">Pranav Anand</a>, UCSC

<p>Current research on evidentiality centers, with some exceptions,
around evidentials in root declarative clauses. Based on the behaviour of evidentials in such environments, the common view is that evidential markers across languages fall, roughly, into two classes: modal evidentials and illocutionary evidentials. Another popular view is that evidentiality is just a garden variety of epistemic modality. These views make certain predictions with respect to behaviour of evidentials elsewhere.</p>

<p>In my
dissertation prospectus, I present the first up-to-date systematic investigation of interaction evidentials and attitudes across languages. I challenge the predictions of current theories by looking at three dimensions of variation:</p>

<p></p>

<li style="margin-left:30px"><b>embeddability:</b> whether evidentials can be syntactically embedded under attitude predicates;</li>
<li style="margin-left:30px"><b>attitudes:</b> which attitude predicates allow evidentials in their complements;</li>
<li  style="margin-left:30px"><b>shifting:</b> whether evidentials can and must change their perspective when embedded.</li>

<p>I argue that the emerging typology is not predicted by any of the theories and does not straightforwardly resemble the typology of epistemic modals. I further compare evidentials to other context-dependent phenomena and argue that there are robust parallels between evidentials and indexical pronouns.</p>

<h3>evidential shift and indexical component of evidentiality</h3>

<p>In root declarative clauses evidentials are speaker-oriented. In attitude reports, it is not always the case: in some languages, evidentials can or must shift. Previous accounts reduce this phenomenon to different scope construals. I argue that this is not the case and provide evidence that evidentials can be analyzed as having an indexical component.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 20px;"> <small> In root declarative clauses, evidentials are always speaker-oriented. Under attitude predicates, evidentials may sometimes shift, i.e. switch their perspective and become oriented
towards the attitude holder. In the literature on evidentiality, it is common to derive different shifting patterns from the narrow vs. wide scope of the evidential with respect to the
attitude verb. However, this view makes wrong predictions. It also overlooks that the typology of evidentials vis-a-vis their shifting properties resembles the typology of indexicals
and that there are further similarities in the distribution of evidentials and shifted indexicals.
Given this parallel, it seems quite natural to analyse evidential shift and indexical shift in the
same fashion. Sauerland and Schenner (2007) model evidential shift after Schlenker (1999)'s
account of shifted indexicals, so that the locus of cross-linguistic variation is entirely in the
evidential markers. Such view has several drawbacks. In particular, it does not account for
the fact that not all attitude predicates license embedded evidentials. Thus it is desirable to
base an analysis of the evidential shift on a theory that has more space for cross-linguistic
variation. I argue that the Monster theory (Sudo 2012) is a better alternative and provide
an analysis of evidential shift within this system.</small></p>

<p></p>

<h3>non-embeddability of evidentials</h3>

<p>Languages vary in whether they allow evidential markers in embedded contexts or not. Previous accounts claim that non-embeddability is due exclusively to the illocutionary semantics of respective evidentials. I argue against this view and provide counter-examples to it. Based on Krifka's system for embedded speech acts, I develop a semantics for illocutionary yet embeddable evidentials. I further argue that non-embeddability depends on the embedder and on the embedding strategy rather than being a property of a non-embeddable element itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 20px;"><small> Languages vary in whether they allow evidential markers in embedded contexts or not.
Some languages allow evidentials under attitude predicates, e.g. Cheyenne (Murray 2010) or
Cuzco Quechua (Faller 2002). Some languages do not, e.g. Bulgarian, German, or Japanese
(Sauerland and Schenner 2007). In the current literature on evidentiality, it is common to
attribute non-embeddability of respective markers exclusively to their semantic properties:
such evidentials are analysed as speech act modifiers and therefore are expected to be non-
embeddable. This expectation rests upon the assumption that speech acts only correspond
to root clauses. Krifka (forth.) argues that speech acts can, to some extent, serve as arguments to con-
nectives and clause-taking predicates, therefore, are embeddable. I propose that speech acts
with evidentials are no exception and formulate semantics for illocutionary evidentials within
Krifka (forth.)'s framework. I further argue that (non-)embeddability of evidentials does not stem solely from their
illocutionary nature but depends on two factors. (1) The embedding strategy: evidentials
across languages are banned from non-finite clauses. (2) The embedder: attitude predicates
vary in what can appear in their complements, which sheds light on the behaviour of e.g.
epistemic modals (Anand and Hacquard 2013) or shifted indexicals (Sudo 2012). As I will
show, it helps to explain the distribution of evidentials as well.</small></p>

<h1>evidential perfects</h1>

<p>Aside from the dissertation, I am interested in the phenomenon called "perfect of evidentiality", the term due to <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~pancheva/">Roumyana Pancheva</a>. With few exceptions, this issue is almost untouched in the formal literature.</p>

<p>Evidentiality often clusters in certain regions, and where it does, it has a dominant morphosyntactic form, e.g. most evidentials of Western Europe are modal
auxiliaries. Another frequent make-up is (present) perfect morphology. It happens to encode some sort of evidentiality all over the globe: Dogon, Newari,
Scandinavian languages, Spanish of La Paz, Northern
Ostyak, Komi Zyryan. The highest concentration of the perfect-evidential overlap is found in the Balkan-Caucasus region,
sometimes referred to as the Old World evidential belt, including but not limited to Balkan Sprachbund. Most famously described for Turkish as well as other
Turkic languages, it in fact pervades the area and is a feature of
the following languages: Balkan Romance: Aromanian, Daco Romanian, Megleno
Romanian; Iranian: Farsi, Ishkashim, Tajik; Kartvelian: Georgian; Indo-Aryan: Romani; South Slavic:
Bulgarian, Macedonian; Daghestanian: Agul, Archi, Bagvalal, Dargwa, Hunzib;
Indo-European isolates: Eastern Armenian and Albanian. </p>

<p>Such perfects express interesting commonalities: (1) they express indirect evidentiality and are often analysed as two accidentaly homophonous markers, conjectural and reportative  and (2) they encode non-trivial temporal relations between the speech situation and the situation of evidence acquisition.</p>

<p>I've done fieldwork on Georgian, which shows interesting (dis)similiarities with Turkish and Bulgarian both in the evidential domain and interaction of evidentiality with tense and aspect. I'm not actively working on the topic but am still interested in the nature, historic development and georgraphic distribution of the perfect-evidential overlap and in how to derive the meaning of indirect evidentiality without postulating accidental homophony.</p>

<h1>wh-scope marking and related phenomena in the pan-slavic perspective</h1>
<div align="justify">
<p>Slavic languages have constructions consisting of two interrogative
clauses, a clause with the fronted wh-adverbial ('what' or 'how') and a wh-clause with a
fronted wh-phrase. Glossing such a structure word by word, we can obtain the following English sentence:</p>

<p><i>What do you think, when will all the ice melt?</i></p>


<p>Due to superficial similarities, such constructions
were analysed as instances of Wh-Scope Marking.
However, not all of these constructions in Slavic line up with canonical scope
marking as found in German, Hindi or Hungarian. For Russian, I argue that the
clause with the wh-adverbial is a parenthetical that grammaticises one
narrow class of questions frequently met in discourse. Across Slavic
languages, these constructions differ
in a range of parameters: choice of the wh-adverbial ('what' vs. 'how') and its functions
elsewhere in a language, restrictions on mutual order of the clauses,
possibilities of further embedding, prosodic characteristics, etc. Now
I am conducting a detailed language-by-language comparison to establish reasons of such variation. In particular, I am trying to trace the history of these constructions across Slavic and explore whether borrowing from German might have taken place in some languages (e.g. Czech).

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 20px;"><small>This

consisting of two interrogative
clauses, a <i>kak</i>-clause with the fronted <i>wh</i>-adverbial

<i>wh</i>-phrase. This construction was analysed as an
instance of Wh-Scope Marking. However, it
shows a range of puzzling and unexpected properties. I propose an
approach wherein the <i>kak</i>-clause is a parenthetical
and neither of the clauses is syntactically subordinate. <i>Kak</i>-parentheticals

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 20px;">
<small>The paper explores a Russian two-clausal construction that
was previously argued to instantiate
<i>wh</i>-scope marking. I examine a range of syntatic and
semantic properties
of this construction
and show that it is far from canonical scope marking, though might look
similar. I refute the
scope marking analysis as it fails to predict and explain certain
restrictions and propose an
alternative approach, wherein the construction in question is a
parenthetical that triggers a
Potssian conventional implicature. This proposal helps to grasp
restrictions intrinsic to Russian
and broadens the typology of scope marking and similar looking
phenomena.

<h1>adyghe</h1>
<div align="justify">
<p><a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/%5C/15/show_language.asp?code=ady" target="_blank">Adyghe</a> is a Northwest Caucasian language,
spoken mostly in the Caucasus. I'm proud to have participated in a
series of fieldwork trips to the national republic Adyghea organised
and funded by the Russian State University for the Humanities in 2004-2010. Such
trips, or expeditions, are a hallmark of Russian typological tradition, largely thanks to the efforts of late A.E. Kibrik.
Instead of bringing a consultant to the classroom, which is the common practice for the Field Methods in the U.S., a group of people goes into the field to work on a language. In such a setting, one gets acquainted not only with the language itself, but also with the culture of its speakers, which is an essential part of being a fieldworker. Theoretical research is combined with the language documentation component, including, as the ultimate goal, writing a reference grammar with a significant amount of elicited texts. It's in these expeditions where I got the training I have now, learned how to handle raw data and how to analyse them. Without that, it would be impossible for me to have the cross-linguistic component in my dissertation.</p>

<p>Adyghe is a polysynthetic language with complex and fascinating morphological
patterns. Over the years, I have mainly worked on the tense and aspect system, and constraints on affix ordering.
I have been investigating semantics of various tense and aspect suffixes, whose inventory in Adyghe goes beyond the familiar and includes things like 'pretend that <i>p</i>'. In particular, I was working on the so-called double past, which led me to the exploration of semantic typology of pluperfects, their non-temporal values and possible application of inertia worlds apparatus in this domain.</p>

<p>In my own work and in joint work with <a href="http://yulander.narod.ru/">Yury Lander</a>, I showed that
Adyghe affix ordering is compositional in the suffix domain while templatic in the prefix domain.</p>

<p>Currently I am not working on Adyghe though I am still part of the Northwest Caucasian language documentation project, hosted by the Russian State University for the Humanities. In 2009, I contributed to the collection of papers (in Russian) that serves as a basis for a theoretically-informed reference grammar of Adyghe, which members of the project are now writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 20px;"><small>This article deals with the order of verbal suffixes in
Adyghe, a polysynthetic language of the Caucasus. Traditionally the
structure of the
Adyghe wordform and the order of its affixes were described in terms of
template morphology.
However, we present new data demanding another, substantially different
approach.
We demonstrate that for the most part suffix ordering within the Adyghe
verb
follows strictly compositional rules. This feature is a manifestation
of the polysynthetic nature of the language.</small>
