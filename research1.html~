I am a formal semanticist and also I am a fieldworker. 
In my research, I try to keep an eye on the cross-linguistic perspective even if I do not data from primary fieldwork.
I believe that drawing on the data from different languages helps to balance the picture and provides new insights on how meaning works. 


<h1>evidentiality</h1>

<p></p>

<div align="justify">
<h3>dissertation</h3>

committee: <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ysharvit/">Yael Sharvit</a> (co-chair), <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/sportich/sportich.htm">Dominique Sportiche</a> (co-chair), <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/stabler/">Ed Stabler</a>, <a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~panand/">Pranav Anand</a>


<p>Current research on evidentiality centers, with some exceptions,
around evidentials in root declarative clauses. Based on the behaviour of evidentials in such environments, the common view is that evidential markers across languages fall, roughly, into two classes: modal evidentials and illocutionary evidentials. Such a view makes certain predictions with respect to behaviour of evidentials elsewhere.</p>

<p>In my
dissertation, I test these predictions and investigate
cross-linguistic behaviour of
evidentials under attitude predicates. I look at three parameters of variation:</p>

<p></p>

<li style="margin-left:30px"><b>embeddability:</b> whether evidentials can be syntactically embedded under attitude predicates;</li>
<li style="margin-left:30px"><b>attitudes:</b> which attitude predicates allow evidentials in their complements;</li>
<li  style="margin-left:30px"><b>shifting:</b> whether evidentials can and must change their perspective when embedded.</li>

<p>The emerging typology is not predicted by any of the theories, and does not straightforwardly resemble the typology of modals or speech acts. However, there are certain parallels between evidentials and other perspective-sensitive phenomena such as indexicals, logophors, and predicates of personal taste.</p>

<p></p>


<h3>beyond</h3>

<p>Aside from the dissertation, I am interested in the phenomenon called "perfect of evidentiality", the term due to <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~pancheva/">Roumi Pancheva</a>. Except for Pancheva's work, this issue is barely touched in the literature.</p>

<p>Evidentiality often clusters in certain regions, and where it does, it has a dominant morphosyntactic form, e.g. most evidentials of Western Europe are modal
auxiliaries. Another frequent make-up is (present) perfect morphology. It happens to encode some sort of evidentiality all over the globe: Dogon, Newari,
Scandinavian languages, Spanish of La Paz, Northern
Ostyak, Komi Zyryan. The highest concentration of the perfect-evidential overlap is found in the Balkan-Caucasus region,
sometimes referred to as the Old World evidential belt, including but not limited to Balkan Sprachbund. Most famously described for Turkish as well as other
Turkic languages, it in fact pervades the area and is a feature of
the following languages: Balkan Romance: Aromanian, Daco Romanian, Megleno
Romanian; Iranian: Farsi, Ishkashim, Tajik; Kartvelian: Georgian; Indo-Aryan: Romani; South Slavic:
Bulgarian, Macedonian; Daghestanian: Agul, Archi, Bagvalal, Dargwa, Hunzib;
Indo-European isolates: Eastern Armenian and Albanian. </p>

<p>I've done fieldwork on Georgian, which shows interesting (dis)similiarities with Turkish and Bulgarian both in the evidential domain and interaction of evidentiality with tense and aspect. I'm not actively working on the topic but am still interested in the nature, historic development and georgraphic distribution of the perfect-evidential overlap.</p>

<h1>wh-scope marking and related phenomena in pan-slavic perspective</h1>
<div align="justify">
<p>Slavic languages have constructions consisting of two interrogative
clauses, a clause with the fronted wh-adverbial ('what' or 'how') and a wh-clause with a
fronted wh-phrase. Glossing such a structure word by word, we can obtain the following English sentence):</p>

<p><i>What do you think, when will all the ice melt?</i></p>


<p>Due to superficial similarities, such constructions
were analysed as instances of Wh-Scope Marking.
However, not all of these constructions in Slavic line up with canonical scope
marking as found in German, Hindi or Hungarian. For Russian, I argue that the
clause with the wh-adverbial is a parenthetical that grammaticises one
narrow class of questions frequently met in discourse. Across Slavic
languages, these constructions differ
in a range of parameters: choice of the wh-adverbial ('what' vs. 'how') and its functions
elsewhere in a language, restrictions on mutual order of the clauses,
possibilities of further embedding, prosodic characteristics, etc. Now
I am conducting a detailed language-by-language comparison to establish reasons of such variation. In particular, I am trying to trace the history of these constructions across Slavic and explore whether borrowing from German might have taken place in some languages (e.g. Czech).

<h1>adyghe</h1>
<div align="justify">
<p><a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/%5C/15/show_language.asp?code=ady" target="_blank">Adyghe</a> is a Northwest Caucasian language,
spoken mostly in the Caucasus. I'm proud to have participated in a
series of fieldwork trips to the national republic Adyghea organised
and funded by the Russian State University for the Humanities in 2004-2010. Such
trips, or expeditions, are a hallmark of Russian typological tradition, largely thanks to the efforts of late A.E. Kibrik.
Instead of bringing a consultant to the classroom, which is the common practice for the Field Methods in the U.S., a group of people goes into the field to work on a language. In such a setting, one gets acquainted not only with the language itself, but also with the culture of its speakers, which is an essential part of being a fieldworker. Theoretical research is combined with the language documentation component, including writing a reference grammar with a significant amount of elicited texts as the ultimate goal. It's in these expeditions where I got the training I have now, learned how to handle raw data and how to analyse them. Without that, it would be impossible for me to have the cross-linguistic component in my dissertation.</p>

<p>Adyghe is a polysynthetic language with complex and fascinating morphological
patterns. Over the years, I have mainly worked on the tense and aspect system, and constraints on affix ordering.
I have been investigating semantics of various tense and aspect suffixes, whose inventory in Adyghe goes beyond the familiar and includes things like 'pretend that p'. In particular, I was working on the so-called double past, which led me to the exploration of semantic typology of pluperfects, their non-temporal values and possible application of inertia worlds apparatus in this domain.</p>

<p>In my own work and joint work with <a href="http://yulander.narod.ru/">Yury Lander</a>, I showed that
Adyghe affix ordering is compositional in the suffix domain while templatic in the prefix domain.</p>

<p>Currently I am not working on Adyghe though I am still part of the Northwest Caucasian language documentation project, hosted by the Russian State University for the Humanities. In 2009, I contributed to the collection of papers (in Russian) that serves as a basis for a theoretically-informed reference grammar of Adyghe, which members of the project are now writing.</p>
