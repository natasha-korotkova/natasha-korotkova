Below I describe current and past strands of my research program.

<summary>universals and variation in the evidential domain</summary> 
        
        <p>Evidentials are expressions that encode the source of semantically determined information for an utterance, such as English <i>reportedly</i> or <i>allegedly</i>. Over the years, I have worked on grammatical evidentials in several languages (Bulgarian, Georgian, German, Turkish).</p>
        
        <p>An ongoing debate in this area concerns the relation between evidentiality and epistemic modality. According to one line of research, evidentials are garden variety epistemic modals. According to another, evidentials interact with the structure of speech acts. By discussing analytical options proposed for evidentials, I show that the debate is lacking formally-explicit tools that would differentiate between the two classes. Current theories, even though motivated by superficially different data, make in fact very similar predictions. I reduce the cases of apparent semantic variation to factors independent from evidentiality, such as the syntax of clausal complementation, and show that these cases do not resolve the modal-illocutionary debate.</p>
            
            <p>Based on data from a range of languages, I argue that evidentials have a unified semantics of first-person mental states. Drawing on philosophical research on self-knowledge, I further argue that some linguistic properties of evidentials are rooted in the non-linguistic properties of the cognitive processes they describe, and show that it explains in a uniform fashion the behavior of evidentials across enviornments.</p>
        
        <p> Currently I am also interested in constructions dealing with evidence more generally, and am co-editing a special issue of the Journal of Pragmatics devoted to evidence in language (with Corien Bary).</p>

<summary>semantics and metasemantics of taste</summary>   
        
        <p>  My joint work with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~panand/">Pranav Anand</a> (UC Santa Cruz) focuses on the semantics and metasemantics of taste. It explores linguistic and non-linguistic properties of predicates of personal taste (e.g. <i>delicious</i>) and other subjective expressions (e.g. <i>delightful</i>). Recent work in formal semantics and philosophy of language shows that linguistic behavior of PPTs differs from that of other predicates, like <i>round or popular</i>, both in grammatical distribution and conversational dynamics: for example, disagreements over tastiness are seen as matters of opinion, not fact. We aim to determine whether PPTs form a natural class across languages and conceptual domains, and whether other predicates involving judgment -- aesthetic, moral, value -- also are PPTs. The overarching goal is to understand how natural language conceptualizes taste and what makes PPTs special: the semantics, the pragmatics, or the epistemology and psychology of taste. To explore this broader issue, we look at a series of less-studied puzzles and compare PPTs with other taste ascriptions (e.g. <i>to like</i>).</p>

<summary>non-canonical interrogatives across slavic</summary>

    
<p>Slavic languages show great propensity for non-canonical interrogatives, whose primary goal is not a naive inquiry for information but a different pragmatic function. In the past, I have worked on constructions consisting of two interrogative
clauses, a clause with the fronted wh-adverbial ('what' or 'how') and a wh-clause with a
fronted wh-phrase, which have been previously analyzed as an instance of wh-scope marking and which I have argued are interrogative parentheticals. Currently I am exploring biased questions in across Slavic. Questions with espitemic bias, which are used to confirm or rejct an idea the speaker has, have attracted a lot of attention in the recent literature. However, with few exceptions, much of the work in this area has been conducted on the material of English, German and French. Cross-linguistic research is pivotal for semantics and pragmatics, and in this strand, I seek to redress this empirical gap by looking at discourse particles associated with question bias across Slavic.</p>    
    
<!-- have constructions consisting of two interrogative
clauses, a clause with the fronted wh-adverbial ('what' or 'how') and a wh-clause with a
fronted wh-phrase. Glossing such a structure word by word, we can obtain the following English sentence:</p>

<p><i>What do you think, when will all the ice melt?</i></p>


<p>Due to superficial similarities, such constructions
were analysed as instances of Wh-Scope Marking.
However, not all of these constructions in Slavic line up with canonical scope
marking as found in German, Hindi or Hungarian. For Russian, I have argued that the
clause with the wh-adverbial is a parenthetical that grammaticises one
narrow class of questions frequently met in discourse. Across Slavic
languages, these constructions differ
in a range of parameters: choice of the wh-adverbial ('what' vs. 'how') and its functions
elsewhere in a language, restrictions on mutual order of the clauses,
possibilities of further embedding, prosodic characteristics, etc. Now
I am conducting a detailed language-by-language comparison to establish reasons of such variation. In particular, I am looking at the history of these constructions across Slavic and explore whether borrowing from German might have taken place in some languages (e.g. Czech).

    <summary>evidential perfects</summary>

<p>Evidentiality often clusters in certain regions, and where it does, it has a dominant morphosyntactic form, e.g. most evidentials of Western Europe are modal
auxiliaries. Another frequent make-up is (present) perfect morphology, referred to as "Perfect of evidentiality". It happens to encode some sort of evidentiality all over the globe: Dogon, Newari,
Scandinavian languages, Spanish of La Paz, Northern
Ostyak, Komi Zyryan. The highest concentration of the perfect-evidential overlap is found in the Balkan-Caucasus region,
sometimes referred to as the Old World evidential belt, including but not limited to Balkan Sprachbund. Most famously described for Turkish as well as other
Turkic languages, it in fact pervades the area and is a feature of
the following languages: Balkan Romance: Aromanian, Daco Romanian, Megleno
Romanian; Iranian: Farsi, Ishkashim, Tajik; Kartvelian: Georgian; Indo-Aryan: Romani; South Slavic:
Bulgarian, Macedonian; Daghestanian: Agul, Archi, Bagvalal, Dargwa, Hunzib;
Indo-European isolates: Eastern Armenian and Albanian. </p>

<p>Such perfects express interesting commonalities: (1) they express indirect evidentiality and are often analysed as two accidentaly homophonous markers, conjectural and reportative  and (2) they encode non-trivial temporal relations between the speech situation and the situation of evidence acquisition.</p>

<p>I've done fieldwork on Georgian, which shows interesting (dis)similiarities with Turkish and Bulgarian both in the evidential domain and interaction of evidentiality with tense and aspect. I'm not actively working on the topic but am still interested in the nature, historic development and georgraphic distribution of the perfect-evidential overlap and in how to derive the meaning of indirect evidentiality without postulating accidental homophony.</p>

<summary>polysynthetic morphology</summary>
<div align="justify">
<p><a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/%5C/15/show_language.asp?code=ady" target="_blank">Adyghe</a> is a Northwest Caucasian language,
spoken mostly in the Caucasus. I'm proud to have participated in a
series of fieldwork trips to the national republic Adyghea organised
and funded by the Russian State University for the Humanities in 2004-2010. Such
trips, or expeditions, are a hallmark of Russian typological tradition, largely thanks to the efforts of late A.E. Kibrik.
Instead of bringing a consultant to the classroom, which is a common practice for the Field Methods in the U.S., a group of people goes into the field to work on a language. In such a setting, one gets acquainted not only with the language itself, but also with the culture of its speakers, which is an essential part of being a fieldworker. Theoretical research is combined with the language documentation component, including, as the ultimate goal, writing a reference grammar with a significant amount of elicited texts. It's in these expeditions where I got the training I have now.</p>

<p>Adyghe is a polysynthetic language with complex and fascinating morphological
patterns. Over the years, I have mainly worked on the tense and aspect system, and constraints on affix ordering.
I have been investigating semantics of various tense and aspect suffixes, whose inventory in Adyghe goes beyond the familiar and includes things like 'pretend that <i>p</i>'. In particular, I was working on the so-called double past, which led me to the exploration of semantic typology of pluperfects, their non-temporal values and possible application of inertia worlds apparatus in this domain.</p>

<p>In my own work and in joint work with <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/yulander">Yury Lander</a> (Higher School of Economics, Moscow), I showed that
Adyghe affix ordering is compositional in the suffix domain and templatic in the prefix domain.</p>

<p>In 2009, I contributed to the collection of papers (in Russian) that serves as a basis for a theoretically-informed reference grammar of Adyghe, and currently I am not working on this.</p>
