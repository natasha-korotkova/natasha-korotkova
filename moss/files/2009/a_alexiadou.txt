In this talk, I investigate a number of unaccusativity diagnostics
(there-insertion, locative insertion, post-verbal nominatives) that
across languages seem to be sensitive to the type of verb involved.
Specifically, only a subset of unaccusatives is licit in these
environments, namely /verbs of existence or appearance/, but not /verbs
of change of state/. I argue that this behavior reflects a syntactic
difference between the two verb classes and I discuss its implications
for the unaccusativity hypothesis.
