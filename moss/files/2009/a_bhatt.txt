Ormazabal and Romero (2007) noted a peculiar restriction on binding into
clitic clusters in Spanish. Accusative clitics can be freely bound but
not when they co-occur with dative clitics. We find that this phenomena
seems quite general, appearing in Greek, Slovenian, French, varieties of
German, and Czech. The restriction seems modulated to the kind of PCC
effects found in a language. Thus Czech, which has weak PCC effects,
does not rule out rule out all instances of bound accusatives
co-occurring with dative clitics. We propose an analysis in terms of
feature transmission under binding and show that it makes interesting
predictions with respect to de-se interpretations and binding into
appositives. More generally, the data has implications for the
representation of bound pronouns and the nature of binding into attitude
contexts.
